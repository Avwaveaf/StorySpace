- **Custom Animations**: Utilized **MotionLayout** for creating smooth transitions and **shared element animations** for fluid navigation.
- **Widget Integration**: Displays the latest stories right on the home screen using a live widget.
- **Localization and Theme Support**: Users can switch between light/dark themes and multiple languages.
- **Material 3 Design**: Implemented Material 3 design components for a modern UI & Theming.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with Hilt for dependency injection.
- **Intent Gallery**: Accesses the gallery through intents without needing extra permissions.
- **Dynamic Transitions**: Used shared element and transition animations for a polished user experience.
